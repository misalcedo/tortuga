= Background

Tortuga is an actor-based programming language. The goal of the language is to explore language theory and concurrency.
Contains 2 main ideas:

. Actors
. Messages

Some actors are system actors implemented in "hardware". Others are implemented by the user.
Messages are stored in memory already serialized. All access of the messages is as an index directly into memory.
This makes serializing data for sending over a network extremely simple as the data is already in the correct format.

Actors have continuations. Continuations are instances of an actor.
Actors have behavior, that is the logic the actor will execute.


An actor is a computational entity that, in response to a message it receives, can concurrently:
. send a finite number of messages to other actors
. create a finite number of new actors
. designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives
