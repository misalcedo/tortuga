# Command-Line Interface

The `tortuga` command-line tool is used to interact with all aspects of the Tortuga Programming Language. After you have installed `tortuga`, you can run the `tortuga help` command in your terminal to view the available commands.

The common commands are:

* `tortuga` — Starts an interpreter instance in an interactive prompt.
* `tortuga run <file>` — Builds then runs an input file. The value of the last expression in the file is printed to the terminal.
