# Introduction
Welcome to The Tortuga Programming Language, an introductory book about Tortuga.

Tortuga is a functionally-oriented concurrent programming language. The runtime is a Rust program to provide performance and memory safety; the language compiles to WebAssembly. Using WebAssembly allows developers to utilize their favorite programming language to write extensions for the runtime.

## Who is Tortuga For
Tortuga is currently under active development and makes no guarantees about backwars compatibility. At this time, only use Tortuga for experimentation.
