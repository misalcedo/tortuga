An actor is a computational entity that, in response to a message it receives, can concurrently:
. send a finite number of messages to other actors
. create a finite number of new actors
. designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives

Therefore we need a syntax for 3 actions.

. send a finite number of messages to other actors
. creating a new actor is a message to the system actor with a behavior. The question is how to serialize behavior as a message.
. send self a behavior to use
